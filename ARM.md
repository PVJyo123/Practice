# ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)

### What is a Processor?
```
A processor, also known as a Central Processing Unit (CPU), is the brain of a computer or any computing
device.
- It is the component responsible for executing instructions from programsby performing basic
  arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output (I/O) operations.
- It controls the flow of data in a system.

- A processor runs based on the instruction cycle (fetch-decode-execute-store):
```

### waht is RISC
```
- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) is a CPU architecture design.
- RISC was developed to improve CPU speed and efficiency.
- Earlier CPUs used CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer), which had many complex instructions but took
  more clock cycles to execute.
- RISC was a simplification approach: Instead of making instructions powerful, make them simple but fast.
```

### What is ARM?
```
- ARM stands for Advanced RISC Machine.
- It is a family of computer processors and architectures.
- Developed by ARM Holdings (originally Acorn Computers in the UK).
- ARM does not manufacture processors; it designs and licenses processor architectures
  to companies like Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, etc.
        -- Appleâ€™s M1, M2, A15 processors â†’ ARM-based.
        -- Qualcomm Snapdragon processors â†’ ARM-based.
        -- Samsung Exynos processors â†’ ARM-based.
```

### What Happens If We Donâ€™t Have ARM?
```
ðŸ”¸Phones Would Be Bigger or Battery-Hungry
ARM processors save power.

Without ARM, phones might need bigger batteries and would not last a full day.

ðŸ”¸IoT and Smart Devices May Not Exist
Smart devices like fitness bands, smart bulbs, smart speakers rely on ARMâ€™s small size and efficiency.

Without ARM, many small devices might not even be possible.

ðŸ”¸Mobile Performance Would Be Worse
ARM balances high performance with low power.

Without ARM, mobile devices might use power-hungry processors that generate heat and quickly drain batteries.

ðŸ”¸ Less Affordable Devices
ARM designs are licensed cheaply and are easy to produce.

Without ARM, devices might become more expensive because alternatives could cost more to develop and manufacture.

- Connected to **ALU**

###  ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Performs operations (add, subtract, etc.)
- Works with **Barrel Shifter** for fast execution
- Result is stored back in the register

###  Barrel Shifter
- Pre-processes data (shift/rotate left or right)
- Helps improve instruction speed
- Connected via **B-Bus**

###  A-Bus & B-Bus
- **A-Bus**: Direct path to ALU  
- **B-Bus**: Passes data through the **Barrel Shifter** to ALU

###  Program Counter (PC)
- Holds address of the **next instruction**
- Increments after each instruction

###  Instruction Decoder
- Decodes instructions before execution

###  Data Out Register
- Sends processed data to memory or peripherals

---

## ðŸ”„ Load vs Store Operations

| Operation | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **Load**  | Copies data from **memory â†’ register** |
| **Store** | Copies data from **register â†’ memory** |

>  In ARM, **all manipulations must be done in registers**, not directly on memory.

# ARM REGISTERS

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/845dc995-f763-461f-b0ca-3f558ebbfb5c)
```
In ARM, registers like R0, R1, R2, R3,..., R11 are the general purpose registers.
They are typically used to:
	- Store data (like integers, memory addresses, function parameters).
	- Pass values between functions.
	- Perform arithmetic operations.
	- Carry and transfer data.
```

### Basic example
  -Generally, In arm we use assembly level language.
```
MOV R0, #5    ; Move the value 5 into register R0 (data)
ADD R1, R0, #3 ; Add 3 to the value in R0, result stored in R1
```

### INTRA PROCEDURAL CALL(IP):

| Feature        | Description                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| NAME           |  IP Register (R12)               |
| TYPE           |   temporary register             |
| USAGE SCOPE    |   inside the same function       |
| PURPOSE        |   Temporary storage, scratch data for calculations, address computation, etc.|
| COMMON USE      |   compilers for fast local operations or by assembly for temp values|
```
- Intra-Procedural Call means a call that happens within the
  same function.
- It does not leave the current procedure and does not invoke
  other procedures.
  
- Jumps, loops, or internal control flows that happen inside
  the function boundaries.
```

**Example:**
- When doing intra-procedural operations like temporary calculations or internal jumps, the IP register can temporarily hold data.
  
```
ADD R12, R0, R1  ;  Store temp result in IP (R12)
SUB R2, R12, R3  ;   Use the temp result in further calculation
```
* R12 (IP) is used within the function only for temporary storage.
* It is not saved if another function is called.

## STACK POINTER(SP):

| Feature        | Description                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| NAME           |  SP Register (R13)               |
| DIRECTION      |  Grows downwards                 |
| KEY ROLE       |  inside the same function        |
| PURPOSE        |  Tracks stack memory for function calls, local variables, return addresses|
| AUTOMATIC 
  UPDATE         |   PUSH/POP instructions auto-update SP|
```
The stack is used for:
 â€¢Storing local variables
 â€¢Passing function arguments
 â€¢Saving return addresses
 
The SP tells the processor where this stack data is located in memory.

In ARM architecture, the stack is typically full descending, which means:
 â€¢The stack grows downward (towards lower memory addresses).
 â€¢The SP points to the last pushed item on the stack.
```

#### What does the Stack Pointer (SP) exactly do?
```
The SP register:
â€¢Is automatically updated when:
     oData is pushed (stored) onto the stack âžœ SP decreases.
     oData is popped (retrieved) from the stack âžœ SP increases.

- Push operation (store data)
      PUSH {R0, R1, LR} ; Save registers R0, R1, and Link Register to the stack---SP is automatically decreased.
- Pop operation (retrieve data)
      POP {R0, R1, LR} ; Restore the saved values from the stack---SP is automatically increased.
```
### LINK REGISTER(LR)

| Feature        | Description                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| NAME                |   LR Register (R14)               |
| PURPOSE             |   Holds return address during function calls  |
| USAGE               |   inside the same function       |
| PURPOSE             |   BL stores the return address in LR, BX LR returns|
| DATA COMMOUNICATION |   LR passes the control flow back to the caller, not direct data like general-purpose registers do|

``` 
- It mainly holds the return address when a function (or subroutine) is called.
- LR is to know where to come back after a function is done.
- It helps manage program flow but is not used for data transfer between functions.
- Without LR, the program wouldnâ€™t know how to come back after a function call in ARM.
```

**Different between GPR and LR**

| Aspect        | General-Purpose Registers          | Link Register (LR)  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Purpose       | Store and transfer **data**        | Store **return address**          |
| Usage         | Move, add, subtract, etc.          | Manage function calls and returns |
| Communication | Pass variables, function arguments | Pass the return location          |
| Example       | `MOV R0, #5`                       | `BL function` â†’ `BX LR`           |

                                                                            
### PROGRAM COUNTER(PC)

| Feature             | Details                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Purpose             | Track next instruction             |
| Controls            | Program execution flow             |
| Data Role           | Does not carry data                |
| Affected by         | Branch, Jump, Function calls       |
| Automatic Increment | Usually by 4 bytes per instruction |

```
The Program Counter (PC) is a special-purpose register that holds the memory address of the next instruction the CPU will execute.
- In ARM architecture:
   â€¢The PC tells the CPU where to look next in memory.
   â€¢After executing one instruction, the PC automatically moves to the next     instruction (normally increasing by 4 bytes because each ARM instruction    is 4 bytes long in ARM state).
- It keeps track of the instruction flow.
```
**Example:**

| Step | PC Value | Instruction    |
| ---- | -------- | -------------- |
| 1    | 0x1000   | MOV R0, #5     |
| 2    | 0x1004   | ADD R1, R0, #3 |
| 3    | 0x1008   | BX LR          |
```
- After executing the instruction at 0x1000, the PC automatically moves to    0x1004 to fetch the next instruction.
- The PC does NOT carry or transfer data like general-purpose registers.
- The PC carries the address of instructions, not data values.
```
**Difference between LR and PC**

| Feature           | Link Register (LR)                                       | Program Counter (PC)                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Register Name** | R14                                | R15      |
| **Purpose**       | Stores **return address** during function calls          | Stores the **address of the next instruction** to execute |
| **Role**          | Controls **where to return** after a function            | Controls **current execution location**                   |
| **Updates By**    | Set automatically by `BL` (Branch with Link) instruction | Updates automatically as each instruction is executed     |
| **Type of Flow**  | Manages return flow                                 | Manages program flow                                |
| **Used For**      | Function calls and exceptions                            | Every instruction fetch and execution                     |
| **Access**        | Can be read/written like other registers                 | Can be read/written but usually updated automatically     |
| **Example**       | `BL function` stores return address in LR                | PC always holds the current instruction address           |

### CURRENT PROGRAM STATUS REGISTER(CSPR)

| Feature              | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Register Name        | CPSR (Current Program Status Register)    |
| Controls             | Status flags, processor mode, interrupts,
instruction set |
| Key Flags            | N (Negative), Z (Zero), C (Carry), V (Overflow)  |
| Instruction Set Mode | ARM/Thumb, controlled by T bit           |
| Interrupt Control    | IRQ/FIQ enable/disable                   |
```
- When an interrupt come then ARM mode is changed.
- There are 7 modes in the ARM. User mode, system mode, supervisor mode,      FIQ mode, IRQ mode, abort mode, undefined mode.
```

**CSPR key fields**

| Bits       | Name          | Purpose                                     |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| N (bit 31) | Negative Flag | Set if the result of an operation is negative |
| Z (bit 30) | Zero Flag     | Set if the result is zero                   |
| C (bit 29) | Carry Flag    | Set if there is a carry/borrow in arithmetic|
| V (bit 28) | Overflow Flag | Set if signed overflow occurs               |
| I (bit 7)  | IRQ Disable   | Disables IRQ interrupts when set            |
| F (bit 6)  | FIQ Disable   | Disables FIQ interrupts when set            |
| T (bit 5)  | Thumb State   | 1 = Thumb mode, 0 = ARM mode                |
| M\[4:0]    | Mode Bits     | Defines the processor mode                  |


Status Reporting:
The CPSR tells whether the last operation resulted in zero, a negative number, overflow, or carry.
Mode Control:
CPSR sets the processorâ€™s operating mode (User, Supervisor, IRQ, etc.).
M[4:0] refers to the bottom 5 bits (bits 0 to 4) in the CPSR (Current Program Status Register).
These bits define the current processor mode.
These bits tell the ARM processor which mode it is operating in.

| Mode Name       | Mode Bits | Description                                      |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| User Mode       | `10000`   | Regular application code (unprivileged)          |
| FIQ Mode        | `10001`   | Handles fast interrupts                          |
| IRQ Mode        | `10010`   | Handles standard interrupts                      |
| Supervisor Mode | `10011`   | OS kernel mode, enters after reset               |
| Abort Mode      | `10111`   | Handles memory access errors                     |
| Undefined Mode  | `11011`   | Handles undefined instructions                   |
| System Mode     | `11111`   | Privileged mode (like User but with full access) |


Interrupt Management:
It enables or disables interrupt levels via the I (IRQ) and F (FIQ) bits.
In ARM architecture, the processor can handle two types of hardware interrupts:
â€¢	IRQ (Normal Interrupt)
â€¢	FIQ (Fast Interrupt)
Both are controlled by specific bits in the CPSR register.
An interrupt is a signal that tells the processor to pause its current task and quickly handle something urgent.
Type	Full Form	Priority	Usage
IRQ	Interrupt Request	Lower	General interrupts
FIQ	Fast Interrupt Request	Higher	Time-critical events

How it Works:
â€¢	If the I bit is set (1): IRQs are masked (blocked).
â€¢	If the I bit is cleared (0): IRQs are enabled (allowed to interrupt).
â€¢	If the F bit is set (1): FIQs are masked (blocked).
â€¢	If the F bit is cleared (0): FIQs are enabled (allowed to interrupt).

Instruction Set State:
The T bit in CPSR switches between ARM and Thumb instruction sets.
1. ARM State
â€¢	32-bit instructions
â€¢	Full instruction set: Complex, powerful instructions.
â€¢	PC (Program Counter) usually increases by 4 bytes per instruction.
â€¢	T bit in CPSR = 0
2. Thumb State
â€¢	16-bit instructions (more compact).
â€¢	Smaller code size, useful for low-memory systems.
â€¢	Limited instruction set compared to ARM mode.
â€¢	PC usually increases by 2 bytes per instruction.
â€¢	T bit in CPSR = 1

State	Instruction Size	T Bit in CPSR	Purpose
ARM	32-bit	0	Full feature set
Thumb	16-bit	1	Compact, faster access
Jazelle	Java Bytecode	Special mode	Java hardware support
